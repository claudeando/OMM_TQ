# OMM Frontend Developer Test - Design Conversion

This UI component was developed in React and SASS.

Conventionally, the carousel component is created with some library such as Bootstrap however, this time I would like to highlight that my frontend skills are competent enough not to be reliant on them. 

Most JSX tags are semantically oriented for accessibility such as side navigation buttons wrapped in aside components, article elements, as well as figure components.

As this exam has a deadline of 1-hour time slot, the carousel logic of side navigation might look unfinished. This will be refactored once it has more carousel contents in production.
